A project on react that shows a 3D card on hover would involve creating a card component that displays an image, 
a title, a list, and a button. When the user hovers over the card,
it would use transform CSS properties to rotate and move in the X and Y axis according to the mouse's position,
giving the illusion of a 3D animation. Additionally,
the card's child elements such as the image, title, list, and button would also move along the Z-axis to enhance the 3D effect.
